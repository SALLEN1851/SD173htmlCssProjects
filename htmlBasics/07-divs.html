    <h1>Examples</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Div One</h2>
        <p>Here's something that's fun. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time.

            Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. I like to beat the brush.
            
            Put it in, leave it alone. Look at them little rascals. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way.</p>
    </div>

    <div style="border: 1px solid black">
        <h2>Div Two</h2>
        <p>Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Only eight colors that you need. Let's have a nice tree right here. There comes a nice little fluffer.

            It looks so good, I might as well not stop. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. In this world, everything can be happy. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow.
            
            Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things</p>
    </div>

    <div style="background-color:gray;">
        <h2>Div Three</h2>
    <p>The least little bit can do so much. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas.

        Maybe there's a little something happening right here. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one.
        
        Isn't that fantastic? Just beat the devil out of it. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness.</p>
